[["multiple-linear-regression-extended.html", "Chapter 4 Multiple Linear Regression Extended 4.1 Key Concepts 4.2 Assumptions 4.3 Goodness-of-Fit: R-squared (R²)", " Chapter 4 Multiple Linear Regression Extended Multiple linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. \\[ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + ... + \\beta_nx_n + \\epsilon \\] where: - \\(y\\) is the dependent variable. - \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\) are independent variables. - \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept. - \\(\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_n\\) are the coefficients representing the effect of each independent variable. - \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term. 4.1 Key Concepts 4.1.1 Intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)) The intercept is the expected value of \\(y\\) when all independent variables are zero. 4.1.2 Coefficients (\\(\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_n\\)) These coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, assuming other variables are held constant. 4.1.3 Error Term (\\(\\epsilon\\)) The error term accounts for the difference between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable. 4.2 Assumptions Linearity: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear. No Multicollinearity: Independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. Independence: Observations are independent. Homoscedasticity: Residuals have constant variance at every level of the independent variables. Normality of Residuals: Residuals are normally distributed. 4.3 Goodness-of-Fit: R-squared (R²) R-squared indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. \\[ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2} \\] Multiple linear regression is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple factors influence the outcome.
