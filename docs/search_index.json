Key property: \\(E[y|x] = w^Tx\\). 2.2 Least Squares Linear Regression 2.2.1 Terminology Model: \\(p(y|x, \\theta) = \\mathcal{N}(y|w_0 + w^Tx, \\sigma^2)\\) Parameters: \\(\\theta = (w_0, w, \\sigma^2)\\) \\(w_0\\): Offset/bias term. \\(w\\): Weights or regression coefficients. 2.2.2 Least Squares Estimation Objective: Minimize negative log-likelihood. Residual Sum of Squares (RSS): \\(RSS(w) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_n - w^Tx_n)^2\\) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
